# simple-screepsbot
A simple, finite state machine-based bot for Screeps.

This bot has approximately the same functionality as the default bot in the
private server, but uses a finite state machine in order to use creeps more
efficiently.

It is not a completed codebase, but may be used as a starting point for larger
projects. There are probably a few rough edges here and there, but the code
should be fairly decent.
